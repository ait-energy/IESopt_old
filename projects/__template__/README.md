## Abstract

SalPT is designed to enhance patient satisfaction in healthcare through innovative optimization solutions. This project,
funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, focuses on developing software tools that improve efficiency and
accuracy in patient care. Running from January 2021 to December 2021, SalPT leverages cutting-edge technology to provide
measurable improvements in healthcare outcomes and operational performance.

## Project results

SalPT successfully implemented advanced optimization algorithms to streamline patient care processes, resulting in a 30%
increase in patient satisfaction scores and a 20% reduction in wait times across participating healthcare facilities.
The project also developed a robust data analytics framework that provided actionable insights into patient care
efficiency, significantly enhancing decision-making capabilities.
