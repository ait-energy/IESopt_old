# IESopt: Integrated Energy System Optimization

**IESopt** (_Integrated Energy System Optimization_) is a modeling and optimization framework for integrated energy
systems. It is developed and maintained at the **Center for Energy** at
[AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH](https://www.ait.ac.at/). The framework is designed to support the
optimization of energy systems that are characterized by a high degree of integration between different energy carriers
and sectors. It focuses on offering a modular and adaptable tool for modelers, that does not compromise on performance,
while still being user-friendly. This is enabled by reducing energy system assets to abstract building blocks, that are
supported by specialized implementation, and can be combined into complex systems without the need of a detailed
understanding of mathematical modeling or proficiency in any coding-language.
